									Q: So we'll get started with just
									our basic starter question. Can you briefly just summarize what your research is about,
									your research philosophy? <br></br>

									A: Yeah, well I guess we'll just start there. Yeah, so I'm kind of a mix
									between a circuits person and a design automation person, so I kind of span the two. I like to think
									of it as like nano-architecture, where it's not micro-architecture, but it's not necessarily
									circuits. So I've done a lot of work in like areas that are not digital, but not analog,
									so I've done things with clocking on chips, resonant clocking, now I kind of focus on memories,
									you know, SRAMs, non-volatile memory, these things that are, yeah, between digital and analog
									essentially. But then with a focus on automation, so tools to support them and make
									certain flows and so on. <br></br>

									Q: And then our other starter question is, what makes you
									want to get up in the morning slash stay up late at night to work on? <br></br>

									A: I like getting my hands dirty
									in coding. It actually, I always go back and forth between having a lot of students and having few
									students, because once you have too many students and too many projects, it's hard to do stuff
									yourself. So I always like to try to find a balance there to code. I always joke, like I'm
									an associate dean now, but I'm a dean that codes. <br></br>

									Q: Friday is your day. I love it, I love it. If you
									look at your Git commit history, it would be Fridays. <br></br>

									A: Yeah, except when I'm burnt out from
									a week of meetings. <br></br>

									Q: I can imagine. Yeah, great. Okay, so let's see, some of these questions.
									Can you shortly talk about OpenRAM? Just, yeah, a basic, I think, just an overview,
									I think is what they're looking for. <br></br>

									A: Yeah, I mean, you know, memory compilers are not
									something that's new. Every company has had their own, IP providers have had their own,
									but what we were trying to do is just avoid duplication of effort, like internal projects
									that do the same thing and try to make something that where, especially the commodity parts,
									can be reused among different technologies and so on. And so a lot of memory is technology
									dependent, so it gets challenging there. But there's things like characterization and
									tiling where you can be a little agnostic of the actual details. And so we've tried to do
									this approach where we make it flexible enough that it's a good starting point, but then it's
									also open source, so you can customize it and get it to be exactly what you want. And maybe not,
									you know, not contribute specific things back if they're proprietary. Sure, sure. So it's a
									challenging area. You know, I mentioned in my talk this, you know, UMIPS, which was like a
									analog mixed signal repository where it's very hard to do design in those areas because of the
									proprietoriness of, you know, PDKs. And then Google happened, you know, with this SkyWater
									PDK and it's like, oh, this is a perfect fit. So that's great. <br></br>

									Q: Great. Thank you. What is current mode clocking and what do you think about clockless designs? <br></br>

									A: Oh, clockless designs are great. You know,
									I think, honestly, I would say most people should do asynchronous or clockless design.
									But the problem is we don't educate people to do that and it's challenging to get a workforce.
									So we're kind of stuck, you know, effectively with clocked design. And that's why I've kind
									of worked on that and trying to, you know, I did a number of years on resonant clocking,
									which tries to recycle the energy from the clock. Then I did a number of years with one of my
									students, Radul, on current mode, where it's instead of trying to recycle the energy, people
									didn't like using inductors and stuff on chip because, again, it's analog, it's not digital,
									it's kind of scary. So we went with another approach of just sensing small changes in the
									current, which they've done this for off-chip signaling, you know, like Rambus and companies
									like this for memory interfaces. But those are always point-to-point connections. And so we
									came up with the idea of what if we do a point-to-mini-point for a clock network where
									we can do that. And that introduces new challenges, but also, you know, is a new opportunity for a big
									power-hungry clock network to reduce the power. <br></br>

									Q: So I think this is somewhat related, but what do you see as like the future of clock
									related research going forward? <br></br>

									A: That's an interesting question. I haven't been doing
									clock stuff for a while, you know, maybe I'm kind of thinking about that next thing in my own way.
									I thought the verification talk actually after me was pretty interesting, like trying to verify,
									like, you know, cross-domain clocking and things like that, because designs don't just have a
									single clock domain anymore. Right, right. And so reliability of stuff like that's important. <br></br>

									Q: How do you suggest students and faculty should consider things that they should consider when they want to open source their work?<br></br>

									A: So one thing to consider is, you know, when you open source something, it's one thing to just
									release it and kind of be done with it, which things generally aren't successful if you do that,
									they become stale and kind of don't get updated. So you have to be kind of aware of that there's
									going to be a certain amount of support and overhead that comes with it. And I think that's
									a difficult thing to manage. You know, you're going to have user questions and kind of, you
									know, bug fixes and lots of questions. And so just realizing that, you know, every morning I respond
									to like two or three questions just from someone on Slack, someone over email, you know, some of
									these are like 30, 40 messages deep, you know, helping someone with something. So I think,
									yeah, that amount of time, it's not always a big amount of time, but it's consistent.
									And I guess the more projects you get, the more of that you have. <br></br>

									Q: How do you suggest chip designers stay up to date with fast paced advancements in the hardware
									community without getting overwhelmed? <br></br>

									A: I think conferences like this or workshops like this,
									you know, you can read papers, but often papers have too much information in them.
									There's actually a good, you know, talking to people is much better, but in the event you can't
									meet with people and talk to them, I think there's certain techniques to read papers quick. I go over
									a method with my grad students of doing like a three pass method where the first pass you should
									basically read, skim over a paper and the titles of sections in like 10 minutes and read the
									abstract. And then learn to evaluate, you know, should I go more in depth to it? Then the second
									pass, you kind of want to read it to get the gist of kind of how they do something, but not the
									specifics. And then the third pass, you kind of learn everything and try to recreate it. So trying
									to learn to manage how much time you spend per new thing. Sure, sure. Essentially is something
									that's important to learn and it's a skill to develop. There's a bit of an art to it. Yeah,
									definitely. Because you can prune out a lot of stuff, maybe like 10 minutes. Oh,
									that's interesting, but not for me. Yeah, yeah. And so great. And then when to stop reading papers.<br></br>

									Q: You mentioned in your presentation, you talked about like not being afraid to do small contributions, even teaching people how
									to do a pull request on something as simple as like a typo. How can you, how do you suggest like
									grad students deal with peer or advisor pressure? Like, like, there's, I think there's kind of a
									sense that like, I want to contribute something big. But I think, I think from your talk, you
									made the point that starting small is so important. <br></br>

									A: Yeah, I think starting small is definitely
									important. I think it's important to look at contributions over time. Because, you know,
									when you do a PhD or something, you're going to spend five, six years, you can do little things
									over that time that ultimately look bigger when you get, get to the end. And I think there's,
									there's too much pressure on doing things immediately, where it's, that's why you have
									to focus on kind of small steps. And so I think it's like time management and things like that of,
									you know, set individual goals, like daily goals, like I want to do X today. And it has to be
									something you can do that day, not something that'll take a week. I think Scott mentioned
									something similar about like prototyping a project in like four to five weeks. It's the same
									idea, you want to be able to do kind of quick iterations, like agile development. <br></br>

									Q: Great. Okay, now we've got some kind of more general open source hardware,
									RISC-V related questions. Where do you see the future of the open source hardware community
									and RISC-V headed? Like, do you think it could, you know, start to gravitate more towards being
									an industry standard, almost like Linux has, you know, become the go-to backend? Or do you think
									it'll remain in the domain of academics or like startups that, you know, that, that quick, that
									ability to quickly iterate is so valuable for startups, right? <br></br>

									A: I mean, I'll say it's probably a little controversial at an open source conference, but I'm not against proprietary stuff.
									There's definitely a place for proprietary things. I think the interesting part for a lot of
									most open sources, when things become commodity, there's no reason for people to replicate them.
									You know, I think like ISAs should be a commodity, right? Like there's no reason to have custom ISAs.
									And so I think we're starting to see that more and more with FPGA tools. You know, people are
									doing synthesis now that wouldn't do synthesis a long time ago because FPGAs are a commodity thing
									now. And so that's, that's transforming stuff. And will actual custom silicon, you know, ASIC
									design do that? Maybe. I don't know. I'm not convinced yet. But it could.
									I think one other challenge, one other opportunity for that actually, though,
									is I think with like, what do I call it? Like when we do more multi-die integration,
									there's more like chiplet type stuff. There's more possibility for potentially integrating
									like lower cost, older technologies in a bigger system. I think if we go to a modular type
									approach like that, custom silicon might be more accessible to users, you know, where you can
									put my custom chip with an accelerator in 130 nanometer on top of an Intel CPU,
									you know, or, you know, some custom RISC-V CPU that, you know, SiFive made or something.
									Where you don't have to do the heavy lifting, but you can still do something custom that's
									only cost, you know, thousands of dollars to make. As opposed to magnitude larger.
									So that might happen, but I don't, it's to be determined. <br></br>

									Q: Great, great. This is an interesting
									one. What do you think the position of the open source community should be vis-a-vis generative AI, generative models?
									A bit of a hot topic. <br></br>

									A: Yeah. I mean, yeah, I did my thing at the start of my talk generated by
									chat. I did that this morning. I was just like, oh, it's April fools. So it's interesting. We've talked a lot about it in terms
									of teaching. And you know, one of the things that it's generally good at is it can generate some
									code, right? But it's usually bad at it or there's bugs. <br></br>

									Q: And often in subtle ways. <br></br>

									A: In subtle ways. And I think that's almost an opportunity in some ways where you can have it do a lot of the basic
									boilerplate stuff, but then you have to be knowledgeable enough to fix the problems.
									So that's actually a good way for teaching. It's like, you're almost looking at someone else's
									code that you don't trust. They didn't test it. And so, you know, if we can kind of figure out
									the verification debug type side of stuff for generated things that might happen,
									but that, you know, there's already such an emphasis on verification of human generated stuff
									and how difficult that is. I see it as a big challenge. <br></br>

									Q: We have one kind of just a fun closing question. Hopefully this isn't too controversial.
									Do you have a favorite open source license? <br></br>

									A: Oh, no, I don't. <br></br>

									Q: That seems to be the consensus.<br></br>

									A: I've always just done BSD3 clause. You know, I think they mentioned universities don't like
									Apache, actually. They're worried about us giving away our patents. You know,
									even someone else's patent at the university, you could inadvertently give away. So they don't like
									that. I like it. I think because I think the IP part is an important part, you know, actual patents.
									But, you know, I think GPL is meant to have good security, but companies are afraid of it.
									And so, you know, I definitely didn't want to make OpenRAM GPL just because I wanted
									companies to use it to be able to utilize it. And there's certain companies that won't even
									touch something that's GPL. So I think, yeah, the more permissive, the better.
									Where, in a way, GPL is not permissive because it requires you to do certain things. So
									so things like BSD are actually more permissive.<br></br>

									Q: Thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.<br></br>
